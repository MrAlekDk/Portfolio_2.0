        <p>Hello</p>
        <p>Welcome to the portfolio of Alexander Sørensen, which just so happens to be me.</p>
        <p>This page includes a small introduction of my interests and background, a listing of my educational-background and
        former jobs and my contact information.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>My name is Alexander Jens Peter Mavrina Sørensen and I am currently a student at
        KEA – Copenhagen School of Design and Technology, studying Computer Science (Datamatiker).</p>
    <p>Growing up surrounded by family members being interested in music, technology and science, it only
    made sense that I eventually would follow their footsteps. However, before making the radical carrier-change towards IT and
        computer science, for the longest time I believed that I would be working in the field of science, either as a doctor or chemist,
        which led to my decision of studying pharmaceutical sciences at the university of Copenhagen.</p>
    <p>Even from early childhood, I was interested in computers. I would use hours upon hours playing video games, drawing in paint or
        surf the internet. As I became older, my interested for tech and software only grew; How computers works and are build,
        how to edit videos and photos, how to record, mix and master music or how to live-stream to platforms such as
        Twitch or youtube. The list seems endless at this point. I always wanted, and still want,
        to have my hands in as many bowls as possible.</p>
    <p></p>
